#Reflection for GPS 1

* Before the GPS, I was not confident in my GitHub workflow knowledge and I felt that, when dealing with branches, I was still a little unsure of what to do sometimes. I had to rely on external documents a lot to make sure that I was doing the right thing.

* After the GPS, I could definitely feel that my knowledge of the GitHub workflow had improved, and it became easier to navigate GitHub as well. Working with Narmin on this GPS was really hepful in this regard; we were both a little anxious about working through GitHub's workflow, so working together alleviated some of the stress. We were also able to help each other out a lot with branches, fetching and merging, and merge conflicts.

* I asked my pair and my guide questions regarding the Git workflow - mostly on fetching and merging and merge conflicts. I also had some questions on how to correctly make a pull request and merge branches on GitHub.

* I think I still need some practice with fetching and merging feature branches and the master on Git, but I feel much more confident now than I did before the GPS.

* I had a great experience with my pair, Narmin, and my guide, Hanah. Narmin and I worked very well together, and we were able to get everything done with little trouble while helping each other out along the way. I am very happy with my first GPS.
