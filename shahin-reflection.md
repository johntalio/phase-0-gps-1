# Release 7: Reflect GPS 1.1 

1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	I was struggling with pushing and making repos, changes, and the Github workflow.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	I had all of the above clarified. Although I am still a little bit hazy on merge conflicts. The exercise in this section did not really give good instructions. I knew from my own experience how to have subl reveal conflicting changes because of my codecademy notes.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	I asked my pair a lot of syntax questions mostly. He also knew about the workflow really well.

4. What still confuses you about Git?
	Fetch and Merge.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
	It went very smoothly. John was very chill and knew his stuff. Our instructor was good too and chimed in if we were going the wrong route.
